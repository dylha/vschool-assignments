    <h2>With The Money The Government Spends To Buy The Army Just One Attack Helicopter, It Could Buy Me An Attack Helicopter</h2>

        <p>It’s time to have a talk about our national priorities. Congress acts as though our nation is broke, yet lawmakers have no trouble finding money for the military. The truth is, if America took the $35.5 million it spends on a single <img id="img-one" src="no.jpg" height="140px" width="250x"/> <b>AH-64 Apache</b> attack helicopter and reallocated it, it could easily afford to buy <i>me</i> an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.</p>

        <p>Think about it. America has, <b>by far</b>, the most-funded military in the world. Last year, we spent $581 billion on our military—more than the next 10 biggest military budgets combined. Imagine if, instead of spending millions of dollars on attack helicopters, we took a fraction of that budget and bought an attack helicopter for me.</p>

Unless we’re planning to fight the entire world at once, maybe it would make sense to spend less on the army and give me an AH-64 Apache free of charge.</p>
